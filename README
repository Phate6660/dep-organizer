## Description
A dependency organizer for various programs you may be installing from source.
For example, let's say that you're installing... GIMP.
You think you have all the deps installed but... what's this?
You're missing a couple deps.
Normally someone like me would just install them and get to building,
but you know what that leads to? Forgetting what I installed in the future,
and wondering why I have so many packages installed.

## Usage
This aims to fix that. With this program, I can:
- Track dependencies with `dep-organizer write`
- Remove any duplicate dependencies that may have been tracked with `dep-organizer ammend`
- Stop tracking dependencies with `dep-organizer remove`
- Bulk install the dependencies for a package with `dep-organizer install`
- Bulk remove the dependencies for a package with `dep-organizer uninstall`

## Installation
`git clone https://github.com/Phate6660/dep-organizer && cd dep-organizer`
`cargo build --release` or `cargo install --path .`

## Supported
Package managers:
- apk*
- APT*
- DNF*
- Pacman*
- Portage
- XBPS
- Zypper*

* Untested, awaiting verification of working.

Note: Package managers are identified as their name in all lowercase in the program.

Misc:
- Running as root via `sudo` (only needed for package operations)

## TODO
- Account for more cases of root besides using `sudo`

## Contributing
I have more feature planned for this, not to worry.
But of course, don't hesitate to open an issue if you want a feature.
And of course, contributions are always welcome.

But PLEASE keep in mind. Everything I release is public domain.
So you have to be comfortable with public-domaining your contribution.
